            sensitive information — including health records, personal details,
            and care plans — that participants trust us to protect. Strong data
            security isn't a luxury; it's essential for compliance, service
            continuity, and, most importantly, client trust.`,

By March 2025, the scheme supported over 717,000 active participants — a 3.5% increase in just one quarter. This rapid expansion creates significant operational, compliance, and workforce challenges for NDIS providers.`,

      description: `Many NDIS providers still build rosters by hand — using
            spreadsheets, whiteboards or group chats. It feels simple and
            "free". But the hidden costs add up fast. Every week, managers lose
            hours fixing mistakes. Shifts get double-booked. Overtime blows out
            budgets. Simple slip-ups mean under-claimed hours or overpayments.
